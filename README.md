# Problem Statement:

The business problem for this example is about predicting problems caused by component failures such that the question "What is
the probability that a machine will fail in the near future due to a failure of a certain component?" can be answered.

# 1.2 Overview of the Problem

Predictive maintenance for industry 4.0 is a method of preventing asset failure by analyzing production data to identify patterns and
predict issues before they happen. It is not a surprise therefore, that predictive maintenance has quickly emerged as a leading
Industry 4.0 use case for manufacturers and asset managers. Implementing industrial IoT technologies to monitor asset health,
optimize maintenance schedules, and gaining real-time alerts to operational risks, allows manufacturers to lower service costs,
maximize uptime, and improve production throughput.

A major problem faced by businesses in asset-heavy industries such as manufacturing is the significant costs that are associated
with delays in the production process due to mechanical problems. Most of these businesses are interested in predicting these
problems in advance so that they can proactively prevent the problems before they occur which will reduce the costly impact caused
by downtime.

# 1.3 Real-world/Business objectives and constraints:

1. Interpretability is important.
2. Errors can be very costly.
3. Probability of a data-point belonging to each class i
